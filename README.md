Quick Launch Visual Studio Code from Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt

##Why ?
When working on C++ project with Visual Studio Code, we have to launch the IDE from the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt.
So, we fisrt need to launch Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt from the Windows Start Menu, then navigate to our working folder through some repetitive `cd` and finaly enter `code .` to  open Visual Studio Code.
